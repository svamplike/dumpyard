This for now includes two project at the time of 12-01-2022 9:43 PM
1) Sudoku with Solving Capabilites(Backtracking Basically)
2) Wordle With Solving Capabilites(Basic Stack-queue/loops-list)

Still I'M working on my Memorizer project but it seems to have many obstacles but still its a long way
hence these are the shorter ones.
